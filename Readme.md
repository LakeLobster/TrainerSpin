## Trainer Spin

A simple application I made to freewheel a Tacx Neo T2 smart trainer.
Freewheeling allows me to adjust the deraileur while on the trainer.

Open the app, connect to a Neo2t, and set the slope to something negative. Turn the crank a bit and it should start freewheeling.

Not much to it.


### Building
Should open and build in Android Studio without too much yak-shaving, but who knows how much has changed since I built this.
